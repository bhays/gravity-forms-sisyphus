Gravity Forms Sisyphus
======================

Version 2.0.1

Allow for saving & resuming of your form data with the visitor's local storage using [Sisyphus.js](http://sisyphus-js.herokuapp.com/) until the form is submitted.

Persist your form's data in a browser's Local Storage and never loose them on occasional tabs closing, going offline, browser crashes and other disasters!
